## Introduction

This project aims to create a cost-effective alternative to Apple CarPlay for your car's infotainment system. By using a Raspberry Pi and some additional components, you can enjoy features similar to Apple CarPlay on your car's display.

## Building the Operating System

**Note: This project is in progress and is not yet finished.**

To build the operating system for your Raspberry Pi-based car infotainment system, follow these steps:

### Setup a New Build Machine

The purpose of this step is to set up a new build machine that will be used to build the operating system.

To set up, run the following command in your terminal:
  
  ```bash
  $ ./setup_new_build_machine.sh -i
  ```

To uninstall, use:

  ```bash
  $ ./setup_new_build_machine.sh -u
  ```
