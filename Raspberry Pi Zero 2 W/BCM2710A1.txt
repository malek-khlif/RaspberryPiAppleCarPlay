SPEC:
-----

The Raspberry Pi RP3A0 is our first System-in-Package (SiP) 
consisting of a Broadcom BCM2710A1 — which is the silicon die packaged 
inside the Broadcom BCM2837 chip which is used on the Raspberry Pi 3 — along with 512MB of DRAM.

> Please refer to the following BCM2836 document for details on the ARM peripherals specification, which also applies to the BCM2837

In other words the BCM2710A1 is a component within the BCM2837. 
It refers to the silicon die (the actual integrated circuit) that contains the ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores.
So, the BCM2710A1 is a specific part or section of the BCM2837 SoC (System on a Chip).

In summary, the BCM2837 is the entire system-on-chip (SoC), while the BCM2710A1 is a part of the BCM2837, specifically the
silicon die that contains the CPU cores
